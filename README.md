# Welcome

Welcome to the **CERT of Catalonia**.

This GitBook is designed as a practical reference for security analysts, incident responders, and digital forensics teams. Its purpose is to document, in a structured and repeatable way, the **artifacts left behind by tools and techniques commonly observed during intrusions**, with a strong focus on detection and post-incident analysis.

You will find actionable information related to:

- System artifacts (registry, files, services).
- Execution and configuration traces.
- Observable indicators on endpoints and networks.
- Differences between portable and installable versions when applicable.

The goal is not to explain how these tools are used, but **how to identify them and understand their footprint from a defensive perspective**.

# Who are we?

## Incident Response Team of Catalonia-CERT

The **Catalonia-CERT** is the cybersecurity incident response center for Catalonia. Its purpose is to be a reliable and trusted point of contact for reporting, communicating, and managing cybersecurity incidents. The team operates under the *Agència de Ciberseguretat de Catalunya* and serves as the region’s official Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) for the Government of Catalonia.

Our mission is to provide coordinated cybersecurity incident handling, working with public institutions, local administrations, healthcare, universities, businesses, and citizens. We implement internationally recognized best practices for incident management, following models such as those defined by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University.

Catalonia-CERT is also an official member of FIRST, the global Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, connecting with over 350 teams worldwide to share insights, warnings, and collaboration on threats.
