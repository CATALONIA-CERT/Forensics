# Who are we?

## Welcome to the Incident Response Team of Catalonia-CERT

The **Catalonia-CERT** is the cybersecurity incident response center for Catalonia. Its purpose is to be a reliable and trusted point of contact for reporting, communicating, and managing cybersecurity incidents. The team operates under the *Agència de Ciberseguretat de Catalunya* and serves as the region’s official Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) for the Government of Catalonia.

Our mission is to provide coordinated cybersecurity incident handling, working with public institutions, local administrations, healthcare, universities, businesses, and citizens. We implement internationally recognized best practices for incident management, following models such as those defined by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University.

Catalonia-CERT is also an official member of FIRST, the global Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, connecting with over 350 teams worldwide to share insights, warnings, and collaboration on threats.
